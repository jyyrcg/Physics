    <h1>About Mac</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Jennifer McElrath, and I&#8217;m here to kick ass. I currently work at Hatboro-Horsham High School. The kids aren&#8217;t great, but my room is very spacious and perfect for my plethora of physics-related hilly-wackles. This is the first time I&#8217;ve spent more than 4 years in one school because my husband was deployed twice in Iraq, so I&#8217;m accustomed to moving around frequently. Staying in one state for so long has come at a great time as my three kids are in their high school/college stage and it&#8217;s much easier to keep them all in one place and hold down the fort without moving the fort around.</p>
      <p>I was born and raised in Southern California and have been surfing since I was 14 days old. I was born to ride the wave, and I use this experience often in my Physics classroom. The waves have shown me that ownership is an illusion; we are all simply byproducts of the oceans. Never forget that.</p>
      <p>Though many people may not know it, I have a love for metal music, with some of my favorite bands being Five Finger Death Punch (5FDP) and Disturbed. I just find their music to be incredibly relaxing and invigorating; sometimes it can be a great motivator to finish grading those final AP Physics tests. Because the grades in that class can be so bad, this music is a much needed pick-me-up, and provides me a sense of peace in this turbulent world of physics academia.</p>
      <p>Sometimes I need to alleviate the pressure of all these physics classes. That&#8217;s when Party Jen comes alive. Yes, yes, I did tell myself that this persona would be dead after my freshman year of college. But, at times like these, I need to bring her back alive. The first thing I do is dress in a luxuriously fluffy pink robe, complete with bunny slippers. I then pull out my largest bottle of Merlot, which I bought at the local drug store. I am a classy woman. I then uncork the bottle and dump all its contents into my 120 oz. wine glass that I got custom made. I drink three sips. That&#8217;s all for tonight. I pour the rest down the drain. I then get cracking on these tests. I manage to grade three before I fall asleep into a wine-induced coma. Goodnight, all.</p>
      <p>Walking around the halls with my &quot;Boss B****&quot; mug, I, Jennifer McElrath, am the ultimate Physics Rock Star.
