      <h2>Inertia and the First Law</h2>
      <p>The branch of physics that involves the description and causes of motion is mechanics.</p>
      <p>Inertia means that matter stays in a state of rest if it is currently at rest and stays in a state of constant speed in a straight line if it is moving.</p>
      <p>Newton’s first law of physics states: An object at rest will remain at rest, or if in uniform motion (constant speed in a straight line) will continue as such, unless acted upon by a net (unbalanced) force.</p>
      <h2>Types of Forces</h2>
      <p>Contact forces involve two systems that are touching. Noncontact forces involve interactions between two systems that do not actually touch.</p>
      <p>Normal force, friction force, and tension are both contact forces.</p>
      <p>Normal force is the force between two surfaces that acts perpendicular to the surface.</p>
      <p>Friction force is the force exerted between two surfaces that acts parallel to the surface.</p>
      <p>Tension is the force exerted by ropes or rods to attached objects.</p>
      <p>Weight is the gravitational attraction between the Earth and an object. Because gravity does not require direct contact, weight is a noncontact force.</p>
      <h2>Freebody Diagrams</h2>
      <p>Freebody diagrams will be your best friend in Mechanics! A free body diagram is a properly oriented representation of the system removed from its surrounding, but showing all interactions as force vectors, represented as arrows coming out of the body.</p>
      <h2>Action and Reaction and the Third Law</h2>
      <p>Newton&#8217;s third law of physics states: When an interaction takes place between two systems, each system exerts a force on the other, and these forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.</p>
      <h2>Newton's Second Law</h2>
      <p>Newton&#8217;s second law of physics states: net force = mass * acceleration</p>
      <h2>Ideal Pulleys</h2>
      <p>Ideal pulleys are frictionless and add no inertia to the system.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>A real pulley will not allow for the masses to accelerate if the tensions are equal on each side of the pulley. In the limit of an idealized pulley, however, these two tensions can be considered equal, so tension is the same throughout the rope.</li>
          <li>You’ll need to adopt a sign convention to determine positive and negative quantities. One approach is to focus on the pulley rotation, arbitrarily calling counterclockwise rotation positive. Forces that tend to cause this type of rotation will be positive, while those that oppose it will be negative. Similarly, accelerations that increase the rate of counterclockwise rotation will be considered positive.</li>
        </ol>
      <h2>Translational Equilibrium</h2>
      <p>A system is in translational equilibrium if the net force on the system is zero.</p>
      <p>Centripetal acceleration is the rate of change of tangential velocity.</p>
      <p>Centripetal force is the name for the net force acting toward the center of an object moving in a circle.</p>
