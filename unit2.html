      <h2>Scalars and Vectors</h2>
      <p>A scalar is a quantity having only magnitude and no direction. Examples include time, temperature, mass, and energy.</p>
      <p>A vector is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction. Examples include displacement, velocity, acceleration, and force.  Vectors are labeled using boldface or by putting an arrow on top of the label. Vectors are depicted graphically as an arrow, with the arrow&#8217;s length relative to the vector&#8217;s magnitude and the arrow&#8217;s direction the indication of the direction of the vector.</p>
      <h2>Vector Multiplication</h2>
      <p>When a vector is multiplied by a scalar, the magnitude of the vector will change, but its direction will not.</p>
      <p>The resultant, the sum of two vectors, is the vector that extends from the tail of A to the head of B.</p>
      <p>Unit vectors are vectors of length one unit that point in either the x- or y-direction.</p>
      <p>The two ways to calculate the product of two vectors is dot product and cross product. Dot product produces a scalar from the two vectors. Cross product produces a new vector from the two original vectors.</p>
      <p>The right-hand rule is a great way to determine the direction of the cross-product.</p>
      <h2>Projectile Motion</h2>
      <p>A projectile is an object that is moving near the surface of Earth and is under only by its downward force of gravity.</p>
      <h2>Uniform Circular Motion</h2>
      <p>Consider an object moving in a circle at constant speed. Since the direction of the velocity vector is changing, the object is accelerating. In this case, v is the linear speed of the object along the arc, and omega is the rate at which the angle increases, the angular velocity.</p>
      <p>Because the acceleration is always directed toward the center, it is called the centripetal acceleration.</p>
